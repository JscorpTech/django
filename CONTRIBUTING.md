## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions with other contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your changes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/django.git
cd django
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Development Setup

This is a cookiecutter template project. To test your changes:

1. Install cookiecutter:
```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

2. Generate a project from your local template:
```bash
cookiecutter /path/to/your/local/django/template
```

3. Test the generated project

## Making Changes

### Template Changes

When modifying the template:

1. **Files in `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/`** - These are template files
2. **Use Jinja2 syntax** for conditional content: `{% if cookiecutter.option %}`
3. **Test with different configurations** - Try different cookiecutter.json options
4. **Update documentation** - Keep README.MD and README.EN.md in sync

### Hook Changes

When modifying hooks in `hooks/`:

1. Test both success and failure scenarios
2. Add proper error handling
3. Print helpful messages for users

## Testing

Before submitting changes:

1. **Test template generation:**
```bash
cookiecutter . --no-input
```

2. **Test with various options:**
```bash
cookiecutter . --no-input celery=yes silk=yes channels=yes
```

3. **Test the generated project:**
```bash
cd generated_project
make up
make test
```

4. **Check for common issues:**
   - Missing imports
   - Typos in variable names
   - Invalid Python syntax
   - Missing dependencies
   - Security vulnerabilities

## Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes:**
```bash
git add .
